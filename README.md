# Raymond Weil Watch Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the work for a data engineering project focused on scraping and analyzing watch data from the Raymond Weil website(https://www.raymond-weil.com/en/). Developed during a data engineering bootcamp facilitated by the Saudi Digital Academy in collaboration with WeCloudData, this project showcases a practical application of data engineering techniques from data extraction to visualization.

## Objectives
- **Automated Data Collection:** Use Python scripts to automatically scrape detailed watch data from the Raymond Weil website.
- **Data Storage:** Store the scraped data in a structured CSV file, generated automatically by the script.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the collected data, providing insights into different aspects of the watch data like types, pricing, and features.

## Repository Contents
- `RCP_RaymondWeil_Visualuzation_Team8_online2.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that includes visualizations of the watch data.
- `RaymondWeil_WatchData_2024-05-11_19-51.csv`: An automatically generated CSV file containing detailed entries of watches scraped from the website. This file includes information such as reference numbers, prices, and other specific attributes of watches.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Used for scripting the data scraping and analysis processes.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Employed for creating interactive visual content and sharing insights.
- **BeautifulSoup & Pandas:** Used for scraping web pages and data manipulation, respectively.
- **Matplotlib:** Utilized for generating visualizations in the notebook.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
