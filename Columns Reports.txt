Insights and Challenges Report

1- Insight on Price Information:

It is crucial to highlight that the website lacks pricing details for watches in Saudi Arabia. As a result, the "price" column in our CSV file is left empty for all entries, creating a significant issue in our dataset analysis. Therefore, we have set the currency column to a hardcoded USD value, emphasizing the significance of this absence in our exploration.


2- Challenges:

	* Case Sensitivity Issues: The dataset has case sensitivity challenges, especially evident in the "type" column, where terms like "Gents" and "gents" are mistakenly identified as 	separate categories. This discrepancy undermines data consistency and necessitates normalization to ensure accurate analysis.

	* Data Completeness: The absence of entries in several columns, including "year_introduced," highlights gaps in the dataset that limit our analysis's depth and reliability. 	Addressing these gaps is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.

	* Characteristic Diversity: While the dataset provides detailed characteristics of watches, the diversity of these attributes presents standardization challenges for analysis. 	Systematic categorization efforts are needed to leverage these details effectively.


Conclusion: The dataset's lack of price information for the Saudi Arabian market and issues with data uniformity present significant challenges. Enhancing the dataset through meticulous data cleaning, standardization, and efforts to include missing price details will substantially improve its utility for our analysis. Future efforts should aim at enriching the dataset with essential information and improving consistency to better serve our needs in Saudi Arabia.
